# chestxray14
This project applies PyTorch to classify 14 thoracic diseases using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. It includes model explainability with Grad-CAM and optimization for edge deployment.

## Goals
- Multi-label image classification
- Medical model interpretability
- Model optimization for edge devices

## Techniques Used
- CNNs (ResNet/DenseNet)
- Grad-CAM explainability
- AUC-ROC evaluation
- PyTorch + Torchvision

## Results
Work in progress.

## Usage
Install the required dependencies and run the training script from the repository root:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

## Future Work
- ONNX export
- Quantization/pruning
